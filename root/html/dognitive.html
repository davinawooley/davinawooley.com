                Our goal was to develop a digital tool to help dog owners improve their dog training skills by more closely aligning their understandings of dog cognition with those of professional trainers. 
                <br><br>Our design is grounded in qualitative data collected through semi-structured interviews.
                
                <h1 id="sectionHead">Research Questions</h1>
                <p id="bioBody">
                
            • How does the way a dog trainer thinks about their dog affect their ability to train it?
            <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspo How do novice/intermediate trainers approach a training task as opposed to a professional trainer? What is the difference in their thought process? Why?
            <br>• Why do people think about dogs the way they do?
            <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspo What distinguishes a novice/intermediate trainer from a professional trainer in terms of why they train dogs the way they do?
            <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspo What causes the dissonance between how novice/intermediate trainers train dogs and how professional trainers train dogs?
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1 id="sectionHead">Methodology</h1>
<p id="bioBody">
        
            In this stage of data collection, we conducted virtual semi-structured interviews (30-60 minutes each) with six participants across a variety of experience levels of dog training. <br><br>One participant is a Certified Professional Dog Trainer-Knowledge Assessed (CPDT-KA).<br> Two other participants are researchers who have worked in dog-related research, are familiar with the literature on dog cognition, and have experience training dogs for research.<br> Our other three participants are dog owners who have done some informal training with their dogs at home.

         </p> 
         <h1 id="sectionHead">Affinity Mapping</h1>
         <p id="bioBody"> 
We used the affinity mapping framework to identify overarching themes and patterns in our participants’ interviews. Our team members all reviewed the data and collaboratively and dynamically
sorted our notes, promoting interrater reliability.
            </p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td id="topRow"><strong>Green – Top-Level Themes</strong></td>
        <td id="topRow"><strong>Pink – Secondary Themes</strong></td>
        <td id="topRow"><strong>Blue – Tertiary Themes</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>UI/UX Designer & Researcher</td>

        <td id="makeInline">Illustrator & Figma</td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p id="bioBody">
    
Our affinity mapping process yields some key insights into aligning dog owners’ cognitive processes with those of professional dog trainers. Participants with successful prior experience in training dogs discussed how understanding conditioning approaches (such as operant and classical conditioning) assisted in effective training. In addition, successful trainers emphasized understanding dog body language and structuring personalized training regimens.
</p>
<h1 id="sectionHead">Findings</h1>
<p id="bioBody"> 
From our interviews with dog owners who were not successful in training their dogs, we gathered that many of them could not tell why their dog was doing what it was doing. <br><br> Or if their actions had any direct impact on the dog. <br><br> They also expressed that during training, they were uncertain as to whether the dog was learning or if their feedback was effective. <br><br> The owners did not have an accurate representation of the dog’s behaviors and could not accurately map those behaviors to emotional states. Because of this, the owners believed that their work was in vain deterred them from future training efforts. <br><br>
More experienced dog trainers mentioned that this fundamental misunderstanding of canine body language can lead to high distress for both the dog and the trainer. <br><br> This finding is important to note so that we can include common dog behaviors and stressors for trainers to avoid implementing.
<br><br>Dog owners who struggled with training expressed that their dogs would behave well when in low-stimulus environments but would appear to ignore or forget their training in high-stimulus environments. This finding is important for our deliverable so that we can implement some sort of checklist of certain environmental controls for the trainer to check for.


</p>
<h1 id="sectionHead">Conclusion</h1>
<p id="bioBody"> 
Effective dog training fundamentally relies on effective communication.
<br><br> Solutions trying to improve struggling dog trainers’ understanding of dog cognition should focus upon teaching how to identify what motivates a dog (treats, toys, affection, etc.) and understanding a dog’s body language.
<br><br> Successful dog trainers highlighted this mutual understanding as fundamental to
effective training: it allowed them to personalize their training and understand if their teachings were getting through. <br><br>This finding is important so that we can start filling in the gaps of the owner’s understanding of what stimulus leads to certain dog behaviors, and how they can capitalize on it to ensure successful training sessions.
<br><br>With a mutual understanding established, future solutions should then guide pet owners in developing a personalized training regimen and structuring it. Not only will structured, personalized training be effective for the dog, but repetition and practice will instill confidence in a previously doubtful trainer and encourage them to continue training their dog. With this in mind, we will implement pop-up reminders and notifications that will encourage dog owners to keep up with the structured training program to help them achieve their goals.

<h1 id="sectionHead">Prototype Implementation</h1>
<p id="bioBody">
Our prototype, named “Dognitive Science”, is a mobile application prototype that was designed and developed by our team using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe XD. Our team designed the layout of the applications and determined the different “screens” that the application required. Our prototype and design decisions were all influenced by key insights obtained from our interviews, described in the previous section.

</p>

<h1 id="sectionHead">Validation Plan</h1>
<p id="bioBody">
We are actively recruiting dog owners who are not professional dog trainers to test our prototype. We plan to have at least 5 people test the mobile application prototype.
<br><br>We will conduct cognitive walkthroughs with each participant to identify design weaknesses and ensure that the app is usable. Each participant will be asked to use the application to help them train their dog to do a task – for testing purposes, the task will be to teach the dog to learn how to sit. Mainly, we want to see if the user can glean useful information from the training tool. At the end of the testing, we will ask the participant the following questions:
<br><br>• Were you able to accomplish the task?
<br><br>• Was the information presented in this tool new to you?
<br><br>• Was the information presented in this tool confusing or unclear?
<br><br>Based on initial testing, we will be able to 1) improve upon the usability and design of our app, and 2) understand if the tool is working as intended. If most users are able to accomplish the task of training their dog to sit using the tool, this will tell us that the app is effective in bridging the gap between professional and non-professional trainers’ understanding of dog cognition.


<h1 id="sectionHead">Key Takeaways & Lessons Learned</h1>
<p id="bioBody">
The way that the professional and expert-level dog trainers positioned dog cognition aligns with Newell's theory of the knowledge level  -  principle of rationality as “If an agent has knowledge that one of its actions will lead to one of its goals, then the agent will select that action”. Our expert-level trainers consistently emphasized the importance of understanding a dog’s motivation and leveraging highly motivating rewards in training,

suggesting that dogs are rational agents acting towards their goals. <br><br>Furthermore, Newell defines an agent as having knowledge when “its behavior can be computed according to the principle of rationality”. The expert-level trainers understand that dogs produce certain behavior in response to specific stimuli in hopes of a reward—that is, they believe that dog behavior is predictable based on the stimuli offered and the motivating goal.
