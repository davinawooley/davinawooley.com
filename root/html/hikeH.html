            Hiking is an excellent activity that presents a unique opportunity for its participants to exercise, enjoy nature, socialize, and take a mental break from the chaos of everyday life. My goal was to create a product that inspires people to hike while simplifying
            the logistical requirements associated with planning group trips.

        <p id="bioBody">
            No applications are offering services that are created for the purpose of helping hikers choose and schedule hiking trips. This application can bring ease to hikers which can result in a greater likelihood that they will hike and use the service. The
            goal is to minimize the users' logistical concerns, allowing them to focus on the hike more than the planning, scheduling, coordinating and communicating with others.

            <br>● What are the excuses people use to avoid hiking?
            <br>● What additional activities do you like to participate in while on a hiking trip? (e.g. climbing, kayaking, biking, camping, etc.)
            <br>● How often do you hike throughout the year, and what factors motivate your decisions?
            <br>● How many hiking trips do they schedule and ultimately cancel each year? Why?
            <br>● What are the factors used to determine which trail you choose? (eg. location, difficulty, trail completion time, views, landmarks, etc.)
            <br>● Do you prefer to hike in groups or alone? How do you coordinate hiking trips? What are associated hurdles? </p>
        <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p id="bioBody"> One individual interviewed has a friendly competition with a friend in a similar activity to hiking, so we could see competition being a small factor for some users. Many interviewees did not like using their phones during hikes. A few people
            liked to track their steps and calories on the trail. Everyone liked hiking with at least a small group of friends, and all individuals interviewed stated that they like to hike because they enjoy being outdoors.

        <p id="bioBody">

            The key design criteria identified from our data are Convenience, Seclusion, Community, and Safety.
            <br> <br> Convenience - users want to find trails that are nearby and easy to access quickly. They want to if the trail has the features and amenities that they want, trail difficulty, and level of preparedness needed so that they can find
            an ideal path with little time and effort spent.
            <br> <br> Seclusion - Hikers do not mind using technology in preparation of thei hike. However when on the trail; they want to be "in the moment" and "aware of their surroundings" on the trail, often wanting to use technology as little as
            possible.
            <br> <br>Community - My interviewees strongly prefer bonding with others on hikes and sharing unique outdoor experiences. There may be friendly competition at times, but the technology needs to include a strong social component that encourages
            collaboration and is easily accessible for both new and experienced hikers.Encourage groups of individuals to hike.
            <br> <br> Safety - Some users were very invested in ensuring that their chosen trail was low-risk and that in case of an emergency they can receive assistance.

            There were two 45 minute long ideation sessions that produced 110 ideas. The goal was to keep the design criteria in mind and come up with as many judgement free ideas as possible, and the primary technique used was reframing user problems and create
            solutions.

            <br>
            <br> To select the final design concept, I looked at the Ideas generated, and analyzed them in terms of implementation feasibility. I then studied if different ideas satisfy market and user needs that are backed by our data. Finally, which
            concept follows our design criteria the best? Community was the most importand design criteria, as determined from the data.
            <br> After creating the ideas I separated the ideas into main categories. I choose which categories were most relevant to our user and market needs. Green sticky noted indicate the most relevant categories, and the blue sticky notes beneath
            highlight the most relevant ideas. I thought that planning a group hiking event and finding people to join you in your hike, satisfied our design requirements and met unsatisfied needs.
            <br> Finally, the Idea for HikeHerd was born and I began determining features and ultimately prototyping concepts.

            <br>● Focus on Community and Convenience : Our interviewees liked the social aspects of hiking, yet sometimes struggled with planning. This website will provide features to the user to help them plan and obtain information regarding their
            hike in a centralized location.

            <br><br>● Stakeholders : The most relevant stakeholders would be enthusiastic hikers looking to hike with groups of individuals. Primarily this appeals to our John Walker persona, which includes individuals that want to plan hikes with others,
            track progress, and belong to an enthusiastic hiking-centered community. This app will likely appeal to enthusiastic hikers of ages 20-45.
            <br><br>● Tech Innovation : There are no major social media or event planning and management sites created around Hiking that we are aware of. This is a novel concept that helps bring people together around their interest in hiking.
